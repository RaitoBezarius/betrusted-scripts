# betrusted-scripts

Scripts to provision Precursor using a Raspberry Pi plus the Raspberry Pi debug hat.

## Setup

The core scripts most users will want to use are `provision-fw.sh`, `provision-xous.sh`, `config_up5k.sh`,
and `wfx_firmware.sh`.

These scripts assume the following file structure:

```
/home/pi/
   |
  code---
        |
        ------ betrusted-scripts
        |
        ------ precursors
	|
	------ fomu-flash
```

This repo uses submodules, so be sure to either clone using `--recursive` or call a
`git submodule init && git submodule update` after cloning.

Note that the `jtag-tools` has dependencies, please consult its README file on how to
setup and install.

Furthermore note that you will need [fomu-flash](https://github.com/betrusted-io/fomu-flash) installed
and built for the Pi. Please refer to its repo for compilation and installation instructions.

If you want GDB debugging capability, you may also want to install [wishbone-tool](https://wishbone-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wishbone-tool/) and plug Precursor's USB port into the Raspberry Pi's USB port.

## Usage

There are corresponding `buildpush.sh` scripts in the firmware
generation directories for Xous (xous-core), the validation firmware
image (betrusted-soc/fw), and the EC image (betrusted-ec/sw) that will
build firmware images and copy them to the `code/precursors` directory on the
Raspberry Pi automatically, once you specify the IP address of the Pi
and a ssh private key file (if used).

Here is a description of the relevant commands, in the order that you would execute them to bring up a board "from factory blank state" (that is, with brand new, blank FLASH memories everywhere):

- `wfx-firmware.sh` will write the firmware blob for the SiLabs WF200 to the EC's SPI memory space. Note that the WF200 is an untrusted entity, and the system trusts the WF200 precisely as much as it would trust any cable modem or core router.
- `config_up5k.sh` will set the QE bit of the EC SPI memory and provision an image located in `precursors/bt-ec.bin` onto the EC SPI. This effectively provisions the EC.
- `provision_fw.sh` will burn both an FPGA image `precursors/encrypted.bin` and a firmware file `precursors/betrusted-soc.bin` to the correct locations in SoC FLASH space. This is used for the low-level validation (if you plan to use Xous, use `provision_xous.sh`, this is unecessary).
- `provision_xous.sh` will burn both an FPGA image `precursors/encrypted.bin` and a firmware file `precursors/xous.img` to the correct locations in SoC FLASH space. This used for Xous.

The validation image boots directly from SPI, but Xous boots from
internal ROM, which is why the provisioning scripts are different. The
intention is that eventually cryptographic boot/signature checks will
be made available in the ROM that make it safer to load the Xous OS
image from SPI, but these have not yet been written, whereas the
validation firmware's intention is a factory test to be run only in
the factory and then erased; however it's also very useful for developers
who want direct access to the hardware or who want to develop or port their
own OS to Precursor.

Note that an "encrypted" image is used for the FPGA by default; however,
for FPGAs that have not been sealed by the end user, the encrypted image
is encrypted by default to the "dummy key", e.g. an AES key of all 0's.

## Other scripts

Some other scripts included here:

- `vbus.sh` -- takes an argument `0` or `1` to turn off or on the power to Precursor. Do not turn on power to Precursor if you have it already plugged into a charger. This script is mostly useful for low-level debug of stand-alone boards.
- `uart_fpga.sh` -- mux the SoC UART to the Rpi `/dev/ttyS0`
- `uart_up5k.sh` -- mux the EC UART to the Rpi `/dev/ttyS0`
- `reset-soc.sh` -- pulls the PROG_N line on the SoC, forcing it to reload. Also resets the SPI ROM out of OPI mode.
- `reset-ec.sh` -- pulls the CRESET_B line on the EC, forcing it to reload.
- `start-gdb*.sh` -- will start `wishbone-tools` wish some defaults that enable variations of GDB connectivity, either via USB, TTY, or otherwise. Assumes `crossover` UART unless `-noterm` is used. Requires a .csv file that describes the FPGA in question, which should be provisioned automatically if you use the `buildpush.sh` script in the correpsonding FPGA's repo.
